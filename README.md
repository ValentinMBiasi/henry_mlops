# MLOps - Movies API and Recommendation System

This is my 1st individual project for the last part of SoyHenry Data Science Bootcamp.

We are asked to create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of a Machine Learning product in 1 week, performing an ETL, creating a recommender system, and deploying the API.

During the project I performed the following tasks:
  - Data cleaning with Python
  - Data preprocessing for Machine Learning
  - Developing a Recommender System for movies with Scikit-learn and Surprise
  - Development of an API with Fastapi
  - Deployment of the API with Render
